  # Fix Ticket Comments RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Disable RLS temporarily for ticket_comments to work with external auth
    - This allows the application to work while external authentication is configured
    
  2. Security Note
    - RLS is disabled for compatibility with external authentication system
    - Consider implementing proper RLS policies once authentication is fully integrated
