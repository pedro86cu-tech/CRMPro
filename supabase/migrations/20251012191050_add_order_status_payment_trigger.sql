/*
  # Add automatic payment status update trigger

  1. Changes
    - Create function to automatically update payment_status when order status changes
    - Create trigger that fires when order status is updated to 'completed'
    - Automatically sets payment_status to 'paid' when order is completed
  
  2. Business Logic
    - When order status = 'completed' â†’ payment_status = 'paid'
    - This ensures consistency across the system
    - Prevents manual errors in payment tracking
  
  3. Notes
    - This is a database-level automation
    - Works regardless of where the update comes from (UI, API, etc.)
    - Can be extended with more business rules as needed
